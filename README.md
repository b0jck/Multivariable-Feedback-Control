# Multivariable-Feedback-Control
This project is divided into four homeworks, each covering different topics. In each folder there's one or two main Matlab live scripts (.mlx) that contain all the simulation code. All extra files are auxiliary functions (.m files) and data vectors used in plots (.mat files). Some folders also include Simulink files (.slx) whose functioning is explained in the file itself. Here's a brief summary of the folders' content:
## Homework 1
- H-infinity control design for SISO systems (using sensitivity weights)
## Homework 2
- Design limitations due to non-minimum-phase systems
- Augmented Plant framework for control design
- Uncertainty representation and Robust stability (SISO case)
## Homework 3
- MIMO systems' input/output direction and Singular Value Decomposition
- Scaling of MIMO systems in controller design
- Uncertainty representation and Robust stability for MIMO systems
## Homework 4
- Robust Perfromance analysis and controller design for MIMO systems
- MIMO system poles and transmission zeros computation and analysis
- Decoupling schemes for MIMO systems
- Limitations due to non-minimum-phase transimssion zeros
